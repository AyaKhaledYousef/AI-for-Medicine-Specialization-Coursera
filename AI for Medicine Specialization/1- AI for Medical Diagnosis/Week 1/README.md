## Our data split into three 3 parts and we have 3 key challenges:

- When we split a data set in the traditional way, images are randomly assigned to one of the sets. Notice that this way we get X-rays that belong to the same patient in different sets. **This is the problem of patient overlap**
![False Splitting](https://github.com/AyaKhaledYousef/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization-Coursera/blob/main/AI%20for%20Medicine%20Specialization/1-%20AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/Week%201/False%20Splitting.png)

- Instead, when we split a dataset by patient, all of the X-rays that belong to the same patient are in the same set.
